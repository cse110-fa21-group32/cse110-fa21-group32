## Today's Topics
Today's Meeting we basically checks the progress of every part.
1. **backend**
- Node.js vs Python Frameworks
	- Node.js preferable to Python(dont need large scale)
	- Python framework side, limited resources on how to connect
	- harder to introduce new members to Python
	- node-sqlite needs to be researched
	- babble(vanilla JS complier)
2. **Spoonacular**
- explore Spoonacular API
- Finds some useful apis which could be used on search by key word functionality
- It is not free so how to use this one
3. **Frontend**
- Aim to create a SPA for our app i.e we need a router

## Future Plan:
1. Assign later issues to memebers such as: user login page, useful libraries for search by key word etc.
2. Keep working on completing functionality
3. Backend needs to begin interact with frontend
4. Schedule another meeting on Saturday
