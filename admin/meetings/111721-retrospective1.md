## Summary
After we voted for useful comments, we talk about the problems that we might have or certain things that can be done better regarding the project. Thus, we came up with our Action Plan.

## Mad:
- "Not understanding a lot of Javascript"
- "Not too familiar with js, html, nor anything else regarding web development. Struggling when making a big project by using those."
- "So hard to find useful tutorials :("
- "Trying to understand and implement SPA for our project."
- "Although we used a library to implement calendar, which helped us to implement some functionalities really fast, it takes a lot of time to figure out how to custom the calendar and I feel that the library constrains some customized implementations."
- "The Documentation is really important. Members should try to solve the problem by themselves before asking questions. Otherwise, those questions will be meaningless."
- "Style and workflow very inconsistent across, even with written guidelines"
- "Lack of updates early on (such as with standup)"
- "The most open ended assignment I have worked on so I feel kinda misguided through it"
- "The fact that we, as a class, started the coding aspect so late (week 6/7)üò†"

## Sad:
- "The fact that we have less than 3 weeks left, as stressful/annoying the whole process was/is it is somewhat enjoyableüòî"
- "Pull requests not being reviewed"
- "Integration tutorials are limited for vanilla JS"
- "When little progress is made after spending a certain amount of time striving to solve a problem"
- "Kind of similar to the frustration point, it was sad having certain time and effort going to waste, but that's part of the learning experience."
- "Not as much progress toward MVP as hoped for, things taking longer"
- "Busy with classes, not been able to help others when they need."
- "Independent work is difficult to allocate, more people creating issues would be helpful"
- "Websocket and HTTP server didn't work. Have to use a new framework."
- "Took me a while to get stuff done just because of small misunderstandings of code"
- "Having a hard time understanding how to get the RUD of CRUD to work on the DB"

## Glad
- "Everybody seems to make some progress on the project."
- "Seeing everyones work showed that we have a lot done and we are getting far in the project."
- "Got pipeline and router working more"
- "Frontend and backend can finally communicate and exchange information"
- "Learned much by doing this project and met many wonderful people."
- "The fact that we have an S tier team and everyone is awesomeüôè"
- "It was exciting when we landed on the right track and figured out what we were doing."
- "Team members are willing to communicate with each other which is awesome."
- "I think we have pretty good collaboration and communication all around!"
